Day 6: CSS Box Model & Positioning
The CSS Box Model is the foundation of layout in CSS. Every element on a page is a rectangular box consisting of the following parts:

📦 Box Model Components:
Content – Actual text or images

Padding – Space inside the border, around the content

Border – The edge of the box

Margin – Space outside the border, between elements

div {
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 15px;
  border: 2px solid black;
}
📍 CSS Positioning
Positioning allows you to control how elements are placed in the document.

✅ Position Values:
static – Default (normal flow)

relative – Offset relative to normal position

absolute – Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor

fixed – Fixed to the viewport

sticky – Scrolls until a threshold, then sticks

.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 100px;
}
